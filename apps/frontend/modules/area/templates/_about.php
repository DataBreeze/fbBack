<p>All Data in this section is provided by <a href="http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/recreational/overview/overview.html" target="NEW">NOAA Fisheries</a>.</p>

<p>FishBlab Fishing Spots and Fish includes thousands of marine coastal Fishing Spots in the US and the corresponding Fish Species found at each spot. Along with the Fish Species is the popularity (catch count). This data was provided by <a href="/" onclick="closeDialog();pageShow('fish_data');return false;">NOAA Fisheries Recreational Fishing Surveys</a>. There are 3 main tab sections, Sites, Fish and Catch Chart.

<p>Like other FishBlab.com pages, the data on this page changes when the map is dragged, zoomed or searched. If you want to find out what is going on in a certain area, search or drag the Map to that location. If you don't see any data in the area you are browsing, try zooming the map out to cover more area. At this time FishBlab only contains data for US saltwater locations.</p>
